    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Corndogs are cool. Except for when they're deep-fried. Then they're hot. My dad tried to deep fry a corndog for me one time and it didn't work out. He pulled it straight out of the freezer, dropped it in the grease, and couldn't have left it in there for more than five minutes. It looked done, but when I bit into it, it was still completely frozen in the center. I thought I had chipped a tooth.</p>
