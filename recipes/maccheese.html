    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ah...mac n cheese. As a small child growing up in the middle of Hickville, Nowhere, we'd never heard of Kraft or even kroger brand mac n cheese. I would go outside 2 hours before the sun came up to do my chores, (milk the chickens, rake the mud, etc.) and could always hear mama making the noodles by hand back at the house , pounding the pasta dough with her fist as if it had tried to steal her purse</p>

    <p> -> Insert completely irrelevant, obtrusive ad here, probably</p>

    <p>Ma, Pa, Sis, Bub, and I always looked forward to this cheesy goodness that would be waiting like a warm hug to comfort us at the end of every day. Grandma, rest her soul, used to always say this about mac n cheese: "It's the stuff, kid." I remember the day I left for college and the only thing I packed in my suitcase was a bowl of mama's homemade...</p>
